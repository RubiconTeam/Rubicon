# Rubicon

A custom Godot Engine build integrating a unification of rhythm game elements, characters, and maps!

This engine is designed to be as robust and optimized as possible while still keeping the development workflow as smooth as possible towards developers looking forward to using this engine.

This repository is a sample project for Rubicon users to get started, using assets from the hit indie game [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin).

# Status

This engine is in a very Work-In-Progress state at the moment, so not everything may be functional. The moment we feel like this engine is stable enough to be used in actual fan games is when we will remove the W.I.P and bump up the version to v1.0.

This engine is currently being reformed, so unless you know what you're doing, the engine isn't easily usable at the moment.

# Developing on Rubicon

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following on your device:
- Our custom Godot build containing Rubicon Engine (will be supplied at a later date)
- [rcedit](https://github.com/electron/rcedit) (Windows exclusive, required for Windows exporting)

If you're developing on Rubicon, whether it's contributing to the engine or making your own fan-game, you should be aware that the way this engine handles tasks is nothing like how most other Friday Night Funkin' engines handle them, if the switch to Godot wasn't enough of an indicator.

We plan to have an API Reference and a wiki to help developers better understand the engine more easily, so please bear with us! :pray:

### Languages
  
We primarily support GDScript for developing alongside Rubicon Engine, though depending on if we can, C# support could be possible.

# Compiling

This engine is currently being reformed, so we're not so sure ourselves how we can explain this at the current moment.

# Contributing

We would appreciate your guys' help so much! The main way to help us out would be to submit issues or pull requests. It would be a struggle if everyone split off to make their own version of Rubicon when we could all benefit from it!

Keep in mind that this repository is the sample project. For contributing to the actual code base itself, go to the [rubicon_engine](https://github.com/RubiconTeam/rubicon_engine) and [rubicon_core](https://github.com/RubiconTeam/rubicon_core) repositories.
